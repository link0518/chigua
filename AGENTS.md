# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `index.html` is the Vite HTML shell.
- `index.tsx` bootstraps React and the `AppProvider`.
- `App.tsx` holds the top-level layout and view routing.
- `components/` contains UI views and shared UI (e.g., `HomeView.tsx`, `SketchUI.tsx`).
- `store/` contains app state and context (`AppContext.tsx`).
- `types.ts` holds shared TypeScript types.
- `dist/` is generated by `npm run build` and should not be edited by hand.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs dependencies (Node.js required).
- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server (port `3000`).
- `npm run build` creates a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript + React with `.tsx` for components and JSX.
- Use 2-space indentation, semicolons, and single quotes to match existing files.
- Component files use `PascalCase` (e.g., `AdminDashboard.tsx`); hooks use `useX`.
- Keep shared types in `types.ts` and avoid cross-folder circular imports.

## Testing Guidelines
- No test framework or `npm test` script is configured yet.
- If adding tests, place them as `*.test.tsx` near the component or under `components/__tests__/`, and add a script in `package.json`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- This directory does not appear to be a Git repository, so no history is available.
- If you initialize Git, use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add report modal`, `fix: guard null root`).
- PRs should include a short summary, linked issues, and screenshots for UI changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` (example: `GEMINI_API_KEY=...`).
- Do not commit `.env.local` or other secrets.
